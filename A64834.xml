            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Chriſtian Religion <hi>(as it expoſeth to, ſo it)</hi> fits for, and is ſuited to Suffering as well as Glory: Yea, the <hi>All-wiſe</hi> God hath ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that while we are on this ſide the Grave, ſuch Graces <hi>(as ſuppoſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are preparative to Glory)</hi> ſhould be moſt exerciſed by us, which are to act their part, and to have their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance only in this world; and which indeed had not had an actual being or exiſtence, if Sin had not entred into the
<pb facs="tcp:106424:3"/>world; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch Graces as are <hi>Faith, Repentance, Hope and Patience:</hi> There had been no need of <hi>Faith</hi> for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, if we had not loſt our own; no need of, nor occaſion for <hi>Repentance,</hi> if we had remained Innocent; no room for <hi>Hope,</hi> ſeeing we had been in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſight, enjoyment and poſſeſſion of happineſs, if we had not ſinned; nor any uſe or exerciſe of <hi>Patience,</hi> when there had been no ſuffering, and none there had been, if there had been no Sin: The ſtate of Innocency <hi>(before ſin was)</hi> being in the next degree like to the ſtate of Glory <hi>(when ſin ſhall be no more)</hi> and that excludes theſe, and ſuch like things; for then ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away, and all tears be wiped from their eyes; then Faith ſhall be turned into Viſion, and Hope into Fruition, ſuffering <hi>(and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patience)</hi> ſhall be at an end, as to good and holy men.</p>
            <p>It cannot therefore but be hugely uſeful and advantageous toward the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, exerciſing, promoting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of theſe Graces, to know what an <hi>exceeding ſinful</hi> thing ſin is; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:106424:3"/>that we may ſuffer well, as did <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.-23. and make <hi>Moſes</hi>'s choice, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.25. and not that which is charg'd on <hi>Job</hi> as his, <hi>Chap.</hi> 36, 21. But alſo becauſe, if ever we be ſaved, theſe Graces muſt be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd, and that they are not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be, till ſin appear to us, as it did to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> an exceeding ſinful, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and deſtructive thing. And truly, as Sinners are not like to be awakened hereunto, till the Commandment come (<hi>as it did to the</hi> Apoſtle) and diſcover it to them; ſo they who are awakened and converted, are greatly obliged, and <hi>no leſs provokt by it,</hi> to admire the love and mercy of God, and to pay him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting gratitudes for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſalvation from ſin. But of the uſefulneſs of this Doctrine I ſpeak in the Treatiſe it ſelf, and ſhall therefore forbear to name any thing more of that Nature in this place.</p>
            <p>As to the Book I have but a few things to ſay; this Treatiſe was began, and almoſt finiſh'd, before the late Sore and great Plague began; and therefore <hi>(though for a memorial of it)</hi> I have taken
<pb facs="tcp:106424:4"/>occaſion to give it a Name or Title from thence, yet it is not calculated particularly thereunto; but with a more general aſpect upon the univerſal miſchief, that <hi>Sin</hi> hath done mankind, as to Soul and Body, Time and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>it being the root of all evil, Corporal, Spiritual, and Eternal,</hi> only in relation to that ſweeping Beeſom of deſtruction, and the dreadful fire from heaven or hell, <hi>and in ſeveral ſenſes from both,</hi> which ſince conſumed the habitations, as the Plague did the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (both which I fear are <hi>(alas!)</hi> but too much forgotten) we ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the operation of Gods hand lifted up, to lay it to heart, to confeſs our ſin, and give him glory: For though God in the midſt of judgment remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred mercy, yet we in the midſt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould remember judgment, both hands being to lead us to repentance; <hi>elſe,</hi> though the <hi>Plague</hi> be over and gone, and that <hi>fire</hi> burns no longer, yet if the plague of our hearts, and not fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry luſts <hi>(if our ſins)</hi> continue, we are far from health and ſafety: If after ſuch deliverances as theſe, we ſin, as if we
<pb facs="tcp:106424:4"/>were deliver'd to do nothing elſe; or to ſpeak as <hi>Ezra</hi> doth, <hi>Ch.</hi> 9.13, 14. and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, ſeeing that God hath puniſhed us leſs then our iniquities have deſerved, and hath given us ſuch deliverance as this, ſhould we again break his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and joyn in affinity with the people of <hi>(with ſuch and the like as our former)</hi> abominations? would not he be angry with us, till he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed us; ſo that there be none <hi>(as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto through mercy there hath been)</hi> remnant, and eſcaping, but the fire of his wrath may burn to <hi>(and we burn in)</hi> the lowermoſt hell! Oh, let us hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.11. for ſin is ſo notoriouſly, more then exceſſively and intollerably evil, that as 'tis <hi>at preſent</hi> the reproach, 'twill be <hi>(hereafter)</hi> the ruine of any people who repent not: And what is impenitency? but a treaſuring up of, and growing rich in ſin and wrath toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.-9. and what is that but to be abundantly damned!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to this Subject,</hi> I am well aware
<pb facs="tcp:106424:5"/>that ſeveral pious and learned men have treated of it; but that is no diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to their Succeſſors to do ſo too, no more then 'twas to S. <hi>Luke (Ch.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3.) to write the Goſpel, of which others had written before him: And indeed, what is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of S. <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> but the ſame Goſpel publiſhed with ſome little variety. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote of the ſame things which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had done, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. and they both wrote of the ſame things over and again, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12, 13. And <hi>Jude</hi> the Brother of <hi>James,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 1. did tranſcribe, or at leaſt Epitomize a great part of S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſecond Epiſtle, almoſt <hi>(in terminis &amp; verbatim)</hi> word for word. I remember S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where gives his advice, to have the ſame things publiſhed by ſeveral men, that <hi>(by the intereſt, relation, and affection which they have in the world)</hi> truths may come to the more hands, which elſe would be confined, and well high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned. Beſide, what <hi>Auſonius</hi> tells us, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>us plus alio invenire poteſt, nemo-om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> is a very great truth, one may find
<pb facs="tcp:106424:5"/>out more then another, but none will or can find and ſpeak out all, ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad are the commands and truths contain'd in the ſacred Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any others: Though <hi>therefore</hi> I think it no diſparagement to me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I have peruſed others, and profited by them, yet I may <hi>(with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity or oſtentation)</hi> ſay, that I have not only handled this Subject in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, but that I have alſo ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to other things, then any hath done that I have yet met withall; and do not doubt, but much more may be ſaid then hath been by me, any, or all that have written on this Theme.</p>
            <p>As to the ſinfulneſs of ſin <hi>(the Subject of the Treatiſe)</hi> I have indeed handled it moſt largely, as 'tis againſt Mans good and happineſs, it being moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the intent and ſcope of the Text; and God is ſo condeſcending, that he is pleaſed to treat man as a ſelf-lover, and ſo to gain him, and win him by his own advantages; yea, he ſeems by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to have a concern for mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>beyond his own vindication in this world,</hi> as the Apoſtle gives us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,

               <hi>As to the ſtile,</hi> I have not minded any curioſity, for I am ſtill of my former opinion, that <hi>that</hi> eloquence doth injury to things, which draws us to obſerve it, ſeeing words are only for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſake, and ſhould not hinder but help its promotion; fine expreſſions <hi>(according to what's ſaid by a Learned and Eloquent perſon)</hi> fine expreſſions are but like the gawdy and guilded frame of a Looking-glaſs, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us not with our faces and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>The genuine uſe of a Looking-glaſs:</hi> yea many times the richneſs of the frame, doth ſo much amuſe and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the eyes of ſome <hi>childiſh perſons,</hi> that they are regardleſs of any thing elſe: The <hi>Rhetorick</hi> diverts men from attending the more concerning, <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive</hi> part of a diſcourſe; yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that pretend to be <hi>Criticks,</hi> make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle other uſe of Sermons and good Books, then to cenſure or to applaud
<pb facs="tcp:106424:6"/>the contrivance, and the phraſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding the Doctrine, or caring to rectifie what hath been diſcover'd to them to be amiſs: <hi>'Tis no commend to a Preacher to be more ſollicitous to make his expreſsions, then to make his Hearers good:</hi> There muſt be no flattering of ſinners; we muſt rather endeavour they may condemn themſelves, then applaud us; and 'twill be more joy to a <hi>good Divine,</hi> to hear the peoples ſighs for their ſins, then to hear their praiſes of his Sermon, and that they follow his counſel, then that they admire his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: We muſt not ſpeak againſt ſin, to ſhew an art of declaiming, a skill of ſpeaking Oratoriouſly, but to exerciſe our own, and to provoke others to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their hatred againſt it; and <hi>'tis to be fear'd,</hi> that when the beſt of men have done their beſt and utmoſt, there will yet be too many that read pious books with leſs reverence and concern then a Romance, or a Play, being more for the Rhetorick then Divinity, for the wit then worth <hi>(which is to ſay)</hi> the ſhadow then ſubſtance of diſcourſes; and (as the forementioned excellent perſon ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly
<pb facs="tcp:106424:7"/>expreſſeth it) <hi>If a devout book have not good ſtore of witty paſſages, ſome Readers will not mind it at all; and if it have, they will mind nothing elſe.</hi> And this experience confirms.

            <p>But not to detain thee much longer, I entreat thee to remember, <hi>that</hi> this world is but a glittering and pompous vanity, a thing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

I entreat thee therefore to exerciſe thy ſelf unto, and in the power of godlineſs, and <hi>do not live as if the practiſe of Piety were nothing but a Book of that Name.</hi> Alas, what is't to have Religion in thy Bible, in thy head and tongue, and yet have none in thine heart and life!

God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell; and <hi>Jude</hi> 6. hath reſerved them in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day. Chriſt Jeſus the Mediator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer took not on him <hi>Angels,</hi> or (as 'tis in the Margine) takes not hold of Angels, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.16. but it pleas'd God to pity <hi>man;</hi> his ſaving grace and loving-kindneſs hath appear'd to <hi>man, Titus</hi> 2.11. and that in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4. whoſe delight was with <hi>the ſons of men,</hi> the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the earth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. and therefore he took on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Hebr.</hi> 2.16. And (4) <hi>this Doctrine of God our Saviour, or the Goſpel-doctrine, doth ſuppoſe man a ſinner:</hi> 'Tis a faithful ſaying, (and worthy of the beſt and all acceptance and reception) that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world (on this very errand and deſign) to ſave ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.

For admiring the free and rich grace of God. (2.) For believing in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. (3.) For vindicating the holy, juſt and good Law of God, and his condemnation of ſinners for breaking of it. (4.) For hating of, repenting for and from ſin, thereby taking a holy, juſt and good revenge on it and our ſelves. (5.) That we may love and ſerve God at a better rate then we ever did, in the little and ſhort time of Innocency it ſelf.

So that by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment ſin appears to be a deſperate malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thing, the proper, true and only cauſe of mans condemnation and death.</p>
            <p>From this brief yet clear account of the Text and Context, theſe following truths are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Text.</note> That <hi>the Law of God in whole and every part is good;</hi> not only not ſin <hi>i. e.</hi> culpable or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, as <hi>v.</hi> 7. or only holy and juſt, <hi>v.</hi> 12. or ſpiritual, <hi>v.</hi> 14. but good, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>good,</hi> not only in it ſelf, but relatively in its inſtitution with reſpect to man, for 'twas ordain'd to life. <hi>v.</hi> 10. Yet</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106424:12"/> 2. This good <hi>Law tranſgreſſed makes man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to death:</hi> Patience, that temperate and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing, (if abuſed) turns to rage and fury; ſo the Law (good though it be, yet) abuſed, it condemns and kills.</p>
            <p>But 3. <hi>Though the Law condemn</hi> mans fault, and man for his fault, <hi>yet ſtill the Law is good, and is not to blame, nor to be blam'd:</hi> The Law is as good as ever 'twas, 'tis to be juſtified by man, even then when it condemns man: As man had no reaſon to break the Law, ſo none to ſind fault with the Law, though it bind men over to death for breaking of it. For</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis</hi> not the Law but <hi>ſin that works mans death and ruine;</hi> ſin aims at no leſs, and <hi>(if grace prevent not)</hi> it will end in no leſs; for the end and wages of ſin is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21, 22.</p>
            <p>Yet 5. <hi>Sin</hi> ('tis true) <hi>worketh mans death and deſtruction by</hi> that which is good, <hi>ſcil. the Law:</hi> when ſin hath uſed man to break the Law, it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Law to break man, to undo him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and death. And</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Sin is therefore exceeding ſinful and wicked,</hi> moſt unmeaſurably ſpiteful, poyſonous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, becauſe it kills men, and not only ſo, but kills them by that which is good, and was appointed to man for life; it turns food into poyſon: <hi>ut agnoſcatur quam ſceleratus peccator ſit hoc peccatum, &amp; quam peſtiſera res, dum per mandatum, rem ſalutiferam, exſerit virus ſuum, Clarius.</hi> Like the horrid and curſed wickedneſs (our ſtories tell us of) ſo wickedly committed, in poyſoning a man, <hi>yea a King,</hi> by the Cup of Bleſſing, So that</p>

            <p>I may not proſecute any of theſe particulars apart, for I ſhall have occaſion enough to ſpeak to every and each of them in handling <hi>the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin;</hi> in relation whereunto I intend to obſerve this method, and to manifeſt thereby</p>

               <p> Before I proceed to the other diſcoveries of mans folly, in relation to the way and means that lead to happineſs, let me briefly evince by three things (among many others that might be named) that mans happineſs cannot be made up of any, or all creature enjoyments, of having (though all) the world for a portion. For beſide what's newly ſaid:</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>It was not ſo when man was in Paradiſe,</hi> when not only man but all the creatures were in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition then, and not ſubject to vanity as now they are: All that God made was very good, and <hi>Adam</hi> had all that God made, and yet that was not his happineſs.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106424:38"/>and ſome to others; but there are two beaſts that all ſinners are likened to; the Goat, and the Dog.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Sinners are called <hi>Goats, Mat.</hi> 25.32, 33. He ſhall ſet the ſheep, <hi>i.e.</hi> the godly on his right hand, and the <hi>Goats, i.e.</hi> the wicked on the left: And there are two or three things which <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> obſerve concerning <hi>Goats,</hi> in which the wicked are like them.</p>
               <p>As 1. <hi>Goats</hi> are very laſcivious, wanton and luſtful; ſinners are ſo too, the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eye, are the things they are taken with, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16.

Thus are they like Goats.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Goats</hi> are very bold and adventurous beaſts, they climb Rocks and Precipices to browſe and feed on what they can get with hazard; and in this ſinners are like them too in running ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and many dangerous adventures for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yea no ſatisfaction; they venture peace, conſcience, life, ſoul and all, to get that which is not bread, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Sinners are likened to <hi>dogs:</hi> I ſhall not run diviſion in this, nor perſecute the Metaphor in proſecuting the particulars, of which there was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106424:38"/>ſomething ſaid a little before, but only to ſhew, that though it were moſt uſual with the <hi>Jews</hi> to call the <hi>Gentiles dogs,</hi> (and our Saviour ſpeaks in their dialect and language, when he told the woman, that 'twas not meet to take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread and caſt it to <hi>dogs, Mat.</hi> 15.26.) yet 'tis a common name to ſinners, whither <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to all without God and Chriſt, for without are <hi>dogs, Revel.</hi> 22.15.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then 'tis but too clear and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, what miſchief ſin hath done man in thus degrading him, by making him a fool, a beaſt, a Monſter; and yet this is not all, but</p>

               <p>From hence come two great miſeries on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from God, as judgments upon this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>God hideth his face;</hi> and this follows on the ſeparation, as 'tis expreſs, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 59.2. Your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have ſeparated you and your God, and your ſin hath hid his face from you, or (as the <hi>Margin</hi> reads it) have made him hide his face
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106424:40"/>from you; his face which makes heaven, a ſmile whereof, or the lifting up the light of which countenance upon us, refreſheth us, more then corn, wine, and oyl, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 4.6, 7. yea, his loving kindneſs is better then life; <hi>we had better have parted with this then that:</hi> Mans ſin is expreſt by this, that he turns his back to God; and not the face; and his puniſhment by this, that God turns his back to him, and not the face; <hi>God carries it not like a friend, but a ſtranger:</hi> And indeed this hiding of his face is ſignificative of many more miſeries then I can now ſtay to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another, and no leſs miſery hereupon is, that <hi>God hears not his prayers,</hi> as it follows in that fore-mentioned Text, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 59.2. and ſo it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the hiding of Gods face, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.15. God is a God hearing prayers, but ſin ſhuts out our ſhouting, and the prayers of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord, and he calls them no better then howlings, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. Yet further.</p>
               <p>There are two or three other miſeries, not to name many more that are conſequent upon this ſeparation, which continually attend poor ſinful man.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That <hi>man is without ſtrength:</hi> Mans great ſtrength is in union with God, <hi>ſeparation wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens him;</hi> for without him, apart from him, out of him, ſeparated from him we can do nothing; to be a ſinner, is to be without ſtrength <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. with 8.

                  </gap>ands are weak, and knees feeble, his legs cannot bear him up, having got the Spiritual Rickers.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Being ſeparated from God, <hi>man becomes afraid of God, and aſhamed to appear before him;</hi> while Innocent (though naked, yet) man was not afraid nor aſhamed to approach to God, or of Gods approaching to him; but when he had ſinned, he was aſham'd to ſhew his face, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſee Gods face, or to hear his voice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>When righteous, he was bold as a Lyon;</hi> but now he runs his head into a buſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>This ſeparation</hi> and departure <hi>hardens his heart againſt God,</hi> that when God comes to talk and treat with man about his ſinning, he will lay it any where, yea at Gods own door (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did) rather then confeſs it: 'Tis <hi>three times</hi> ſaid in one Chapter, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.8.13, 15.

               <p>Thus have I as briefly as ſo large a ſubject would permit, ſet out the ſinfulneſs of ſin, as 'tis againſt the good of man (body and ſoul) in this life, in a natural and moral reſpect, which was the firſt thing propounded. The ſecond follows:</p>

<note n="2" place="margin">The evil Angels.</note> 
                  <hi>the devil and his Angels witneſs ſin to be ſinful,</hi> not only in their being devils by it, and ſuffering for it, but many other ways, as I ſhall evince: We uſe to ſay, that <hi>virtues confeſt by foes, and vices confeſſed by friends, are true:</hi> Surely then by the <hi>Devil</hi> we ſhall find that vice and ſin is, as we have declared it to be; and if ſuch a friend of ſin as the <hi>devil</hi> is, will confeſs it to be ſinful, we may believe him; for though he be the Father of Lies, yet in this he ſpeaks truth, a clear and great truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Then <hi>the devil witneſſeth againſt ſin by his trembling;</hi> the devil trembles at this, that there is a God, <hi>James</hi> 2.19. Now God was never terrible to the Angels till they ſinned, then they ſaw and trembled at the terror of God: Sin brought judgment on the devils, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4 <hi>at this they tremble;</hi> ſo that ſin is the firſt cauſe of devils trembling: That then which makes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils tremble at the belief of a God, (who will be a God of judgment) is exceeding ſinful.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As great as their judgment is (and greater though it be like to be) yet they acknowledge it juſt, and ſo by conſequence ſin to be unjuſt and ſinful: <hi>The juſtneſs of judgment confeſt, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the vileneſs of the ſin which brings the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Say the devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29 Art thou come to torment us before the time? they confeſs that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106424:71"/>the Son of God was to judge them to torment; that they had no exception to make againſt being tormented, but only as to the time; they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in chains to judgment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. and ſay they, art thou come to torment us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time? before the judgment of the great day, to which we are reſerved? they deny not their being worthy of this death, or that their damnation is juſt, and therefore do confeſs the uglineſs and filthineſs of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They witneſs ſin to be ſinful, <hi>in tempting men to ſin:</hi> They uſed to ſay, that ſurely they muſt be good men whom <hi>Nero</hi> hated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; ſo may we ſay, that muſt needs be evil, which the evil one tempts men to, as that is good which he hates and perſecutes; he is the evil one, and the Tempter, <hi>Can that be good that the evil one tempts us to?</hi> Can any good come out of this <hi>Nazareth?</hi> Can any good come from hell? 'Tis enough to evince ſin to be ſinful, that 'tis of the devil, 'tis a clear proof of the evil of ſin, that the devil tempts to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The devil tells us that ſin is an ugly thing by this, that <hi>he turns himſelf into an Angel of Light, that he the more effectually lead us into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> If he ſhould come like a devil, like an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, all would be ſhy of him; but he comes diſguized, and puts on the face of a friend, and ſo puts tricks on us, and cheats us; and indeed doth prevail more by his wily ſubtilties, then by his power: If the devil had come to <hi>Eve</hi> and beſpake her thus, I was once a glorious Angel, and lived above in the Court of Heaven, but I have ſinned, and am caſt down to hell, do thou
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106424:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo eat the forbidden fruit, and thou ſhalt be like me; <hi>would this have taken?</hi> Surely no: So if he did come and tempt men to ſin, and tell them 'tis the ready way to hell, would this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them, to ſwear and whore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, no, the devil is ſubtil <hi>(an old Serpent)</hi> he colours and paints ſin, covers his hook with a bait, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and draws men in ere they are aware: He is a deceiver, but leaſt he ſhould be known, he puts on a good garb, and cloaths himſelf with falſe light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14. And indeed as this is the danger, (leaſt as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> through his ſubtilty, ſo our minds ſhould be corrupted the ſame way, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.) ſo this diſguize and ſubtil transformation, proves ſin to be a monſtrous ugly thing; why elſe doth the devil paint it? why doth he pretend good, when he intends evil? this proves the ſinfulneſs of ſin, that the devil tempts not in his own name or ſhape, he dares not ſay, I am the devil, I am a deceiver, I will lead thee to hell, for that would ſpoil his project.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The devil grants ſin to be the worſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by this, that <hi>all the affliction and miſery which he brings upon men, is to make them ſin more;</hi> ſo that in the devils account, ſin is worſe then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: as it proves the goodneſs of God, that he brings evil on us, to do and make us good, to cure us of the evil of ſin by the evil of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; ſo it argues the ſinfulneſs of the devil, and ſin too, that he brings evil on us to make us worſe; <hi>he doth not care to afflict us ſo much becauſe we have ſinned, as that we may ſin no more.</hi> The end of the devil in perſecuting <hi>Job,</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106424:72"/>to make him ſmart, but to make him ſin, that he might curſe God; 'tis ſomething beyond ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which is worſe then ſuffering, that the devil aims at in bringing ſuffering, and that is ſin.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The devil bears witneſs that ſin is ſinful by this, that <hi>when any are awakened to ſee their own vileneſs, he endeavours all he can to drive them to deſpair;</hi> as he would at firſt they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſin, ſo after that they ſhould not hope for, but deſpair of pardon: he littles it (or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things it) before commiſſion, and greatens it after; when ſin revived, the Apoſtle died, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9 It wrought in him apprehenſions of death and hell, due to that ſtate wherein he then was: when Chriſt Jeſus convinced him of his ſin of perſecution, it made him tremble, and ſtruck him almoſt dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Conviction of ſin pricks men to the heart, and makes them cry out <hi>like undone men,</hi> what ſhall we do! what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us! is there any pardon? is there any hope? Now the devil ſtrikes in, and tells them, that their ſin is greater then can be forgiven. When the poor Penitent was ſorrowful, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil made uſe of his devices that he might be ſwallowed up, and drown'd in ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. with 11. as if he would have told him, if theſe forgive thee not, much leſs will God, the Church hath caſt thee off, and ſo will God: His great deſign is <hi>(then)</hi> to perſwade men, that the Mercy of God, and Merit of Chriſt, is not enough to ſave them. Thus the devil ſpeaks out fully, that ſin is exceeding ſinful.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And laſtly, the devil declares ſin to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

                  <hi>in being the accuſer of the Brethren, Rev.</hi> 12.10. Oh what ſtories doth he tell of God, of the Brethren, how ſinful they are! and thereby confeſſeth to God himſelf the uglineſs of ſin; for from thence only doth he take the riſe, and frame the arguments of his accuſation: as Chriſt ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, ſo the devil lives to make accuſations againſt us, day and night: when God askt the devil if he had conſider'd his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> Yes, ſaith he, I have, and accuſe him for an hired ſervant, one that ſerves thee meerly for wages, and would, if but toucht by thee, curſe thee to thy face. When <hi>Satan</hi> accuſed <hi>Joſhua, Zech.</hi> 3.1, 2. 'twas for his filthy garments, <hi>his iniquity;</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. He is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver telling tales (and ſometimes true ſtories) of the miſcarriages of Profeſſors; he Regiſters their pride and wantonneſs, their vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all their unworthy walkings, and accuſeth them to God for theſe things, and even tempts God, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. to deſtroy them for their ſinfulneſs, and ſometimes, (as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) without a cauſe: whatever he ſay to us, <hi>to be ſure</hi> he ſays to God, that ſin is an exceeding, and out of meaſure, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, when he accuſeth the Brethren.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106424:77"/>made againſt this witneſs of theſe men.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>A poſſe,</hi> from what may be; it may be ſin and ſinners will ſay, 'tis true, theſe men did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſin, and condemn it in others, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to prevent their own; but was it for the uglineſs of ſin, or ſome inconveniences that might elſe befall them? was it becauſe ſin was ſinful, or for ſome other reaſons?</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Ab eſſe,</hi> from what is; though you would make us believe that godly men are ſuch <hi>Ermins,</hi> ſuch nice and tender things, as if they could not endure any uncleanneſs; though you make them ſo ſhy and ſtrict, as if they would not come near a ſin, yet 'tis apparent they have ſinned; yea, the very men whoſe inſtances you pleaſe your ſelf in, and make them patterns to, and Patrons of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Before we can proceed, theſe <hi>Amaſaes</hi> muſt be removed out of the way; and therefore for the removal of the firſt, I anſwer; That though good men (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did) make uſe of all manner of arguments to keep themſelve and others from ſin, yet it is ſin, <hi>as ſin,</hi> that they abhor, as ugly and abominable; though there were no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, no hell, no wrath, yet would regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and new-born men declaim againſt, and hate ſin. As appears</p>
               <p n="1">1 By this, that <hi>the main thing</hi> which keeps them from committing it, or which they repent for having committed it, is, <hi>that it is againſt God:</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> had muſter'd up many arguments, this was the prevailing one with him, how ſhall I do this wickedneſs, and <hi>ſin againſt God, Gen.</hi> 39.9. againſt the will and glory of God. <hi>Job</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106424:78"/>tells us he durſt not ſin; why not? why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'twas <hi>againſt God,</hi> as well as againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1.-4. and in their repentance after a ſin, this goes moſt to their heart, that they have ſinned againſt God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51.4. Againſt thee, <hi>thee only</hi> have I ſinned; how ſo? Surely <hi>David</hi> had ſinned againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and againſt <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and againſt <hi>himſelf</hi> (his bones as well as conſcience felt it.) Oh but this goes moſt to the heart, that <hi>'twas againſt God;</hi> it grieves him more that God was diſpleaſed by him, then that God was diſpleaſed with him; he puts in twice as much of that conſideration, as of any other ingredient; and as to others, his tears run down like rivers, not ſo much becauſe men kept not his, as becauſe they kept not Gods Laws.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By this, becauſe <hi>they abhor all ſin,</hi> all kinds, and all degrees of ſin: Surely we may conclude, that they who hate all ſin, hate ſin as ſin; this godly men do, and only godly men do, and godly men always do it, ſo far as godlineſs acts in power in them: 'tis the prayer in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.133. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſteps (all and every of my ſteps) in thy word, and let <hi>not any</hi> (not any, <hi>i.e. none</hi>) iniquity have dominion over me; from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the greateſt to the leaſt, let <hi>not any one</hi> iniquity have dominion over me.

Now this is no argument that they hate ſin as ſin; <hi>he that hates ſin as ſin, hates all ſin;</hi> and I think it may be inverted truly, <hi>he that hates all ſin, hates ſin as ſin.</hi>

               <p>Yet 2. There is this to be ſaid, that the ſins of good men are more uſually ſins of captivity, then ſins of activity, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>they are rather led into ſin by temptation, then go into ſin by choice and inclination;</hi> 'tis againſt the Law of their mind: 'Tis indeed poſſible that a good man may plot and contrive a ſin, <hi>as</hi> David <hi>did the death of</hi> Uriah; and this is the only thing wherein God himſelf ſaith that <hi>David</hi> ſinned, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5.

               <p>Laſtly, It fully appears that godly men abhor ſin by this, that <hi>they deſire to die</hi> upon no account more then this, <hi>to berid of ſin,</hi> that they may ſin no more, but be holy, as he which hath called them is holy; they groan for a change upon this account, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. mortality and corruption are conjoyn'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and this is not laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide till that be; and therefore they deſire not only to be in Chriſt, where there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. but to be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. which is beſt of all; for there is no ſin, no, nor temptation to it: <hi>There was never a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin in heaven, ſince the devil was caſt out, nor will never be, for the devil ſhall never be there,</hi> nor corruption neither, for that ceaſeth, when mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is ſwallowed up of life: So that upon the whole, the witneſs of godily men is unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, notwithſtanding their having ſinned.

               <p n="3">3 Sin appears exceeding ſinful by the Commandment, in that <hi>it makes uſe of it to ſlay and kill us;</hi> it works our death and ruine by it; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11.-13. Sin at firſt makes us believe (as the Serpent did <hi>Eve</hi>) that we ſhall not die, but live better, and be like Gods: But <hi>James</hi> 1.14, 15. being tempted, enticed and drawn away of our own luſt, then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin; and ſin when it is finiſhed, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth death, yea all ſorts of deaths, <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſpiritual and eternal;</hi> this is the wages and end of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.23.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106424:94"/>condemnation and death; and though God do let ſentence of death paſs upon ſome men, that he may raiſe them from the dead, yet theſe perſons find themſelves dead firſt (before they paſs from death to life) as was the Apoſtles caſe in this place; <hi>Converſion is a Reſurrection from the dead:</hi> Sin kills men, grace revives men; ſo (like the Prodigal) they that were dead, are alive: But by this we ſee the ſinfulneſs of ſin, that it makes uſe of the Law, which was ordain'd to life, to condemn and paſs ſentence of death upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men; that which was made to be our ſtrength againſt ſin, is become the ſtrength of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. Death were weak without its ſting, which is ſin, and ſin were weak without its ſtrength, which is the Law: <hi>Oh ſinful ſin,</hi> exceeding, out of meaſure ſinful, that worketh death by that which is good, and was ordain'd to life!</p>
               <p>Hereupon follow ſeveral things which proclaim the ſinfulneſs of ſin from the mouth of the Law: Do we not hear the Law? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. what dreadful things it ſpeaks againſt the tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
               <p>As 1. This, <hi>The Law allows us no favour,</hi> if we break it in any one thing, though we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in many things, if we keep not all, 'tis as if we kept it not at all; <hi>the Law will not pardon the leaſt ſin;</hi> there is no compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Law, nor compenſating a ſin by doing a duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 25. What profiteth Circumciſion? it profiteth if thou keep the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106424:95"/>Law, but if thou break the Law, Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as uncircumciſion, it profiteth not at all: as one ſinner deſtroyeth much good, ſo doth one ſin; 'tis like a dead fly in a box of oyntment, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. whoſoever ſhall keep the whole, and yet offend in but one point, he is guilty of all (for <hi>the nature of all ſin is in any and every one ſin</hi>) if a man ſin once, though but once, the Law caſts him; for the Law is but the one will of God in divers particulars, either of which tranſgreſſed is againſt the will of God, which runs through all (as a ſilken ſtring through a great many pearls, which if it be cut or broken but in one place, the whole is broken) and where ever there is but one tranſgreſſion, the Law pronounceth the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Had not God provided a City of refuge, a new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way, we had never found any favour from, or by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2, 3. Hence</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The Law</hi> (ſince ſin entred) <hi>cannot juſtifie any man,</hi> it hath loſt its power, and grown weak; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. If it were pitiful, compaſſionate and friendly, yet it wants power to juſtifie us; the Law cannot give life <hi>(though 'twere made to that end) Gal.</hi> 3.21, 22. If there had been a law given, which could have given life, righteouſneſs had been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe (viz. <hi>of life</hi>) might be given to them that believe: If the law <hi>could,</hi> implying that it was not in the laws
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106424:95"/>power, but why not? it could at firſt; true, but 'tis weak through the fleſh, all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under ſin, the law is tranſgreſt, and therefore cannot give life: <hi>Sinful ſin</hi> hath weakned the law, as to the juſtification, but it hath ſtrengthened it, as to the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The law makes ſin abound, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it exceedingly, Gal.</hi> 3.19. Wherefore ſerves the law? of what uſe is the law? It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, to make ſin appear in its own colours: the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mans heart was ſo obliterated, that men could not diſcern ſin by it, as they had wont: for, ſaith the Apoſtle, I had not known ſin but by the law, <hi>viz.</hi> new promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and written, I did not know it by the law in my heart, for that let me alone; ſo that the <hi>law was added to revive the ſight and ſenſe of ſin,</hi> that men might ſee what an ugly thing ſin is, infinitely worſe then men are generally aware of, till the commandment come.

The heir, as he is a Child or Babe, differs nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but is under Tutors and Governours; ſo we (ſaith the Apoſtle) were in bondage, <hi>&amp;c. To be under Tutors, is all one as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Schoolmaſter, and that's to be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bondage:</hi> Many go to School with an ill will, for they go to the <hi>Ferula,</hi> to the Rod, to the Whip, to bondage, to fear and torment; the law doth nothing but frown on us, puts us hard tasks, and laſheth us for non-performance, till Chriſt come, and till we come to Chriſt, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 5.14. The law is the ſtate of bondage and fear; the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are all ſubject to bondage through fear of death, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14, 15. This alſo argues the ſinfulneſs of ſin, that it made the law ſuch a dread and terrour to us (as it is to all) till Chriſt come, who is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. and ſo takes off the <hi>Schoolmaſters</hi> terribleneſs, by taking us into the univerſity of an higher and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> that of believing in him for righteouſneſs, by which we come to have a

               <p n="5">5 <hi>The law ſilenceth man from making any complaint,</hi> how great ſoever the judgment of God be upon him: Mark what, to whom, and to what end and purpoſe the law ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. that every mouth be ſtopt: <hi>All the world muſt be ſilent when God ſpeaks judgment, for all are guilty:</hi> If living man complain, he hath this anſwer preſently, and in ſhort, 'tis for his ſin, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39.

The Apoſtle tells us of ſome who (like <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>) reſiſt the truth, and calls them men of corrupt (or <hi>rotten</hi>) minds: And <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us to know, that as a ſound heart is the life of the fleſh, ſo <hi>Envy</hi> (any thing oppoſed to the ſound heart) is <hi>rottenneſs</hi> to the bones;

When God ſent fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone (<hi>Hell,</hi> as an Ancient calls it) from Heaven on that Center of ſin, <hi>Sodom,</hi> &amp;c. yet ſin got out with <hi>Lot</hi> and his daughters. Fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are very cleanſing and purifying things; yet theſe you ſee have not done it. When others ſinned, the Earth ſwallowed them up, yet ſin remained, it did not dye; <hi>the ſame ſins are ſtill in the world after all theſe judgments.</hi> Even in the Saints themſelves, with all the forces that Faith can make, 'tis very hardly kept under, but the fleſh will be luſting againſt the ſpirit, and when their affections do not cleave to ſin; yet ſin will cleave to their affection, and it makes them cry out as burthen'd with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Wretch that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death! the victory is by Chriſt Ieſus; 'tis death kills ſin. And yet,</p>
               <p n="4">4. It lives in its effects when we are dead and gone; for <hi>it follows us to our grave,</hi> and there it rots our bodies; when it can no longer reach
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106424:110"/>our ſouls to make them vile, it yet forbears not to make our bodies putrid and vile. He that ſinned not ſaw no corruption, but we that ſinned do, and ſtink within a few days, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did. Oh ſinful and infectious ſin!</p>
               <p>Thus far of the names of ſin, and how they witneſs againſt ſin; there remains only one thing more to witneſs againſt it, and that is the ſecond thing I mentioned as to ſin witneſſing againſt it ſelf. <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Arts or Artifices that ſin uſeth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe it ſelf:</hi> if ſin were not an ugly thing, would it wear a vizard? or if it had not evil deſigns, would it walk diſguiſed and change its name? truth is not aſhamed of its name or nakedneſs, it can walk openly and boldly; but ſin is a cheat, a lye, and therefore lurks privily, and puts on falſe names and colours; for if it ſhould appear like it ſelf <hi>(as it ſooner or later will to all, for converſion or confuſion)</hi> it would fright men into dying fits, as it did the Apoſtle, and when they come to themſelves, ingage men to abhor and hate it, as he and the Prodigal did. Men would never be ſo hardy as they are to ſin, but that ſin hardens them, and hardens them by deceiving them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. take heed leſt any be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin: Sin uſeth all manner of Arts, Methods, and Devices <hi>(as Satan doth)</hi> to draw us in, to inveigle us; it puts many tricks upon us, and hath all the faculties and knacks of deceiving and cheating us. I may truly ſay, that ſin hath not learnt, but taught all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, the diſſimulations, flatteries, and <hi>falſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:106424:110"/>that are found in Courts; <hi>the Stratagems</hi> of War, <hi>the Sophiſms</hi> and fallacies of the Schools, <hi>the Frauds</hi> of Tradeſmen, whether in City or Country, <hi>the Tricks</hi> of Cheaters and Juglers, <hi>the Ambuſcadoes</hi> of Thieves, the <hi>Pretenſions</hi> of falſe Friends, the <hi>ſeveral Methods</hi> of falſe Teachers, and whatever elſe there is of <hi>Conſenage</hi> in the World, and practiſeth them all upon us to make us ſin.</p>
               <p>And though it be impoſſible to reckon up all the particular ways whereby the deceitful hearts and ſins of men abuſe them; yet I will inſtance in a few, that it may be for a warning to ſinners, and a witneſs againſt ſin; and then conclude this part of our Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes ſin perſwades us that ſuch or ſuch a thing is no ſin, though it look like a ſin, as the Devil dealt by <hi>Eve</hi> at firſt, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd her: ſhe was a little jealous and ſhy, that what the Serpent put her upon was evil, but he cunningly inſinuates, that however it ſeem'd to her, yet that it was not ſo: This way is the pride and wantonneſs of perſons upheld, that though theſe things are appearances of evil, yet they are not evil: but, alas, <hi>'tis next to being a ſinner to look like a ſinner;</hi> appearance in good is too little, in evil 'tis too much: 'tis a very hard thing to look like a ſinner, to talk and garb it like a ſinner, and not to be one; and which is the worſt on't, 'tis more then likely, that <hi>what the Devil grants to be like a ſin is a ſin;</hi> and they that are perſwaded otherwiſe, are deceived by him, as <hi>Eve</hi> was: 'tis great odds, but if we do like the picture, we ſhall like the thing: though an Idol be no God, nor like him; yet God hath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106424:111"/>utterly forbidden graven images, for they are of the Devils carving.</p>
               <p>If this prevails not, then (2) It would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that though it may be a ſin in another; yet <hi>(rebus ſic ſtantibus)</hi> all things conſider'd, it can be none in thee, becauſe thou art neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as for a poor man to ſteal; but <hi>no man is neceſſitated to ſin, though under neceſſity,</hi> ſin is ſin in any, in all: for though temptations may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigare and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If theſe (or other like) do not prevail, then it ſpeaks more openly; Sin, (ſaith Sin) either there's no ſuch thing, there's no difference between good and evil; as all things come alike to all, ſo all things are alike; or ſaith Sin, evil is good in Gods ſight, elſe he would judge it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. his ſilence bids thee think that he is ſuch an one as thy ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. but here tell ſin, that this defeats and confutes it ſelf, and proves nothing more clear then that ſin is exceeding ſinful: <hi>if there be no ſin,</hi> or no difference between good and evil, to what purpoſe are theſe different words uſed by ſin to prove that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? <hi>to ſay</hi> 'tis only in imagination and not real, is to deny that there is any ſuch thing as ſenſe and conſcience, which every man ownes, and cannot deny without denying himſelf and God to be.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed over and above,</p>
               <p>If ſin were not exceeding ſinful, what need it uſe all theſe tricks and ſubterfuges? if it were not, and its deeds were not evil, why doth it avoid the light?

One may ſay, 'twas good that I was afflicted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71.

All things may be corrected and made to work for our good, and we can ſay, not only God that afflicted me was good, but the affliction wrought for good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. but we can never juſtly ſay, that ſin did us good. Many can ſay <hi>(periiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem niſi periiſſem)</hi> I had been undone had I not ſuffered; but none can ſay <hi>(periiſſem niſi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſem)</hi> I had periſhed if I had not ſinned; no, no, 'tis by ſin we periſh and are undone: many have thankt God for affliction, but never any for ſin. Some indeed miſtake that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. as if the Apoſtle thanked God that they were ſinners, no by no means; but he thanks God that they who once were ſinners, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient to the Goſpel: and the proper ſenſe and reading is, Thanks be to God, <hi>though</hi> ye were the ſervants of ſin (in time paſt) <hi>yet</hi> (now) ye have obeyed the form of Doctrine which was delivered to you, or (as the <hi>Margine</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106424:115"/>and <hi>Greek</hi>) whereunto ye were delivered. <hi>Sin</hi> of it ſelf <hi>is neither good before nor after its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> 'tis not good to be committed, nor good after 'tis committed, nor doth it do us any good, but hurt all our days; but other evils, though we cannot call them good before, and ſo deſire them; yet we can call them good after, and ſo thank God for them.</p>
               <p>More particularly. 1. Suffering may be the object of our choice, which ſin cannot be; for that which is evil, and can be no other (and ſo is ſin) cannot be the object of our volition and choice, <hi>'tis contra-natural.</hi> If men did not call evil good, and good evil, they could never love the evil, nor hate the good: nor can fin be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen as a means to a good; for as 'tis evil and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, ſo it doth evil and nothing elſe.

For men to be ever contradicting and ſwimming againſt the ſtream of their conſcience, which tells them they ought not to ſin, and if they do, chides them for it, muſt needs be uneaſie and unpleaſant: mens ſins make them ſick (as <hi>Amnons</hi> did) ſo far are they from being pleaſures: To deſire the preſence of what's abſent, or the abſence of what's preſent, or the continuance of what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be kept, or the continuance and keeping whereof would ſurfeit them (as the conſtancy of drunkenneſs and intemperance doth do) muſt unavoidably be very tedious; and ſuch men, even in the fulneſs of their ſufficiency (to allude to that in <hi>Job</hi>) cannot but be in ſtraights: <hi>if they gratifie one, they diſpleaſe another of their luſts;</hi> as, if they gratifie pride and prodigality, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe covetouſneſs, and ſo are ſtill far from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, being ev'n diſtracted and ſlain by one or other of their luſts all the day long; they have ſightings without and within, and good men are not more perſecuted by the Devil and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, then theſe men are tormented by their irregular and inordinate fleſhly appetites, and carnal inclinations.</p>

               <p> But yet for all this, men are loth to believe this, which (ſay they) croſſeth Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and their experience: the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the pleaſures of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. and we find the pleaſure on't. Thus men are apt to plead for ſin, and be its Advocate, and can hug any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that doth but ſpeak of (though it diſown and diſallow) any ſuch thing as ſinful pleaſures: As to that miſunderſtood Text, let me ſay this, that <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot be charged with any ſin from whence he drew pleaſure, and therefore by the pleaſures of ſin are not meant ſuch as ſlow from, but ſuch as lead unto ſin; he declined the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which would have inclined him to ſin. Pleaſures are allurements and baits to draw to ſin, as it was to <hi>Eve,</hi> the Tree was pleaſant to the eyes, and inviting; but the taſte and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion found no pleaſure, but bitterneſs from the fruit: thus <hi>Moſes</hi> lived where pleaſures were, and ſuch as tended or were abuſed to ſin, yea, ſuch as he could not have enjoyed without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the great ſin (which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did) <hi>viz.</hi> afflicting the people of God, and being cruel to them, inſtead of delivering them. So that this Scripture ſpeaks nothing in favour of ſin, or that there are any pleaſures to be had by or from it.</p>
               <p>Yet if we ſhould take the Text as interpreted by them, all that can be ſaid of it, is but this, that it ſpeaks as they think, not that there are (but there are thought to be) pleaſures of ſin. <hi>'Tis an ordinary thing for the Scripture to ſpeak of ſuch a thing, as if it were,</hi> and to ſay it is, <hi>which is but ſuppoſed to be by others.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

                  <hi>Thoughts are the firſt-born of the ſoul,</hi> words and actions are but younger brothers: They are the oyl that feeds and maintains the wick, which would elſe go out; life-ſins receive their juyce and nouriſhment from thought-ſins.

Saith holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.113. I hate (vain) thoughts, any thoughts that are againſt thy Law, which I love; we all hate that which is againſt what we love: but why doth he hate thoughts of ſin? becauſe evil thoughts beget evil words, and evil words corrupt good, and beget ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <hi>vain imaginations beget vain converſations:</hi> 'tis hard for them that think well to do ill, and

               <p n="4">4. If we had no other ſins to be pardoned, yet we were to beg pardon for ſinful thoughts: <hi>a may think himſelf to Hell, if the ſinfulneſs of his thoughts be not forgiven him: Acts</hi> 8.20. ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> repent of thy thought-wickedneſs, and pray, <hi>if perhaps</hi> the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee: if God ſhould pardon all our word-ſins and evil deeds, and leave but our thought-ſins unpardoned, we were undone for ever; yea, bleſſed <hi>David</hi> was ſo afraid of ſin, that he begs God to cleanſe him from his ſecret ſins, which lay lurking in his heart, and were undiſcernable there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. if they ſhould not increaſe to more ungodlineſs (which they will attempt, and too eaſily effect) yet there is impiety and ungodlineſs enough in them to ruine us everlaſtingly: Oh, that they would think of it, that make nothing of vain thoughts, no not of evil thoughts, as if they had no evil in them!</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis the great deſign</hi> (and indeed argues the great power) <hi>of the Goſpel, to bring thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> 'Tis far more caſie to reform mens manners, then to renew mens minds, the Laws of men may do that, but 'tis the Law of God doth this.

Converſion begins, is carried on, and is compleated in the heart and thoughts of men. <hi>It begins there,</hi> while men are in (and dead in ſins) they are inconſiderate, and regard not what's in their heart and thoughts; but when the grace of God comes in power, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in truth, they bethink themſelves and conſider, what ſhall we do to be ſaved? men are in a great quandary in their thoughts, they begin to wamble, and their bowels are turned within them: and therefore <hi>regoneration is called the Renewing of the mind,</hi> and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a change of mind, and the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a new heart, and when the heart is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the reſt follows. If the wicked forſake his thoughts, he will quickly forſake his ways, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>The firſt turn is in the thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 119.59. I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies; the thoughts go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the feet follow after: and the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prodigal were in his thoughts, when he came to himſelf, <hi>he ſaid within himſelf,</hi> I will ariſe and go to my father, and while he was thus thinking (which is ſaid, while he was afar off, but taking the firſt ſtep) his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion on him, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:106424:148"/>
               <p> As Converſion begins, ſo its carried on in the heart and thoughts eſpecially, though not only; when others ſtudy (like the Phariſees) only to make the outſide look fair and beautiful, the godly man is employed about his inſide, to keep his heart clean; <hi>the prayers of godly men are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up about their heart, Pſal.</hi> 51.10. create in me a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me. And (as an excellent perſon words it) wherein lyes the difference between ſincere-hearted Chriſtians and others? but in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoughts, without which all Religion is but bodily exerciſe: Papiſts may mumble over their prayers, Hypocrites talk, but <hi>this is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it begins, and is carried on, ſo Converſion is compleated, finiſhed, and perfected in thoughts, it ends there; for when a godly man comes to dye, his chief and laſt employment is about his thoughts; he hath done with works, he hath made his Will, and concluded all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and his ſpeech (it may be) fails him, and then his main work and the concluſion, <hi>the ſhutting up of the whole matter is in his thoughts;</hi> ſo that when he comes into the new world, and continues here, and when he is going into the world to come, his main employment is about and in his thoughts: there he began, and here he ends.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>God keeps an account of, and will call us to account for thoughts,</hi> as well as for words and actions: he hath a book of remembrance writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for them that <hi>think</hi> on his Name, I, and for them that <hi>think</hi> on their ſins too, with ſinful
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:106424:149"/>thoughts. There is no thought hid from him, all things are naked and open before him with whom we have to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. or as the words may be read, before him, <hi>to whom we are to give an account.</hi> God knows our thoughts afar off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2. long before they came out into words or actions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.21. So the father ſaw the Prodigal, while yet afar off, <hi>while but thinking to return:</hi> yea, he doth ſearch and try the heart to this very end, that he may give to every man according to his way, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. God will judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment (not according to appearance, as men do) <hi>as the man thinketh, ſo is he, and ſo ſhall he be judged:</hi> man judgeth our inſide by our outſide, our heart by our works; but God judgeth our outſide by our inſide, our works by our hearts: and 'tis therefore we ſhould fear God, and keep his Commandments, becauſe God will bring, as every work, <hi>ſo, every ſecret thing,</hi> to judgment, whether good or evil, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.13, 14. When the Lord comes, he will bring to light the <hi>hidden</hi> things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the <hi>counſels</hi> of the heart, all the ſecret deſigns and projects of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. and will judge the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of men by Jeſus Chriſt, as our Goſpel teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. Oh think then that for thoughts thou muſt be judged, and therefore make conſcience of them, for not only <hi>ſcientia divina,</hi> Gods ſcience or knowledge, but <hi>conſcientia humana,</hi> mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be (one of the books opened, and) a witneſs in that day, according to which men ſhall be judged.</p>

If he ſeem to be religious, and doth not bridle his tongue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſeeming to be, he is not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: <hi>A ſeeming Religion is worſe then none,</hi> as vanity is leſs then nothing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17. He that hath a form, and but a form of godlineſs, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power thereof, is worſe then he that hath not ſo much as a form, or makes no profeſſion of godlineſs. Oh, how ſhould this oblige us to take heed of tongue-ſins!</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sinful words are arguments of ſinful hearts;</hi> words are the image of the mind, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it: as a man is known by his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ſo an heart by its words. Thou art a <hi>Galilean,</hi> thy ſpeech bewrayeth or diſcovers thee. We may know what Country-men any are by their language, whether <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. whether of the heavenly or helliſh World. 'Tis
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106424:155"/>out of the abundance <hi>(the fulneſs and overflowing of)</hi> the heart, that the mouth ſpeaketh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34. broach any full veſſel, and what's there will come out; words are as the broaching of the heart, and giving it vent, and then out comes that which was within. 'Tis indeed <hi>both poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and common</hi> for perſons to ſpeak well, when they mean ill, peace is in their mouth, when war is in their heart; but that heart is hypocritical, and out of that double heart, which is full of Hypocriſie, they ſpeak with their tongues, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.20. ſo that if wicked men ſpeak well, yet 'tis ſtill from an evil heart of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and out of that abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Evil words corrupt men and their manners:</hi> our great care ſhould be, not to be corrupt, and the next to that, not to corrupt others; but evil words corrupt both: <hi>they corrupt and defile our ſelves, Mat.</hi> 15.17, 18. What goeth into the mouth (<hi>viz.</hi> meat) defileth not the man, but what cometh out of the mouth (<hi>viz.</hi> evil words) proceeds from the heart, and they defile the man. The tongue is but a little member, yet it boaſteth great matters, 'tis but as a ſpark of fire, but it kindles a great deal of wood, a world of iniquity, the whole courſe of nature, and defiles the whole body, <hi>James</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>It defiles,</hi> not only a mans own body and courſe, but <hi>the body and community of them with whom we converſe too,</hi> a little leaven leavens the whole lump: be not deceived, evil communication corrupts good manners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. What's the ill language or evil diſcourſe the Apoſtle
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106424:155"/>means? That which he had mentioned, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. let us (ſay and do like <hi>Epicures,</hi> as they ſay and do) let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye. <hi>Such looſe Epicurean and Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical diſcourſes do debauch men and their manners.</hi> Many an ingenuous and hopeful perſon hath been corrupted by ſuch ill diſcourſe: they have no good converſation, who uſe evil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; perſons of evil words are ſeldom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good manners, or if ſo for a while (for <hi>nemo repentè fit peſſimus</hi>) none being ſuddenly wicked, or worſt at firſt, yet they degenerate and grow immoral and ill-manner'd more and more. Lying frequently makes men at laſt ſo unacquainted with truth, that they ſcarce think any difference to be between them; and they jeſt ſo long, that they forget to be in earneſt, till awaked by the quarrels that theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in and among themſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The tongue is either mans glory of ſhame,</hi> worth much or nothing, as 'tis good or evil. God made mans tongue his glory, but ſin makes it his ſhame. Saith holy <hi>David</hi> to his tongue, awake, <hi>my glory, Pſal.</hi> 57.8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9. <hi>my glory</hi> rejoyceth; which the Apoſtle (according to the Septuagint) renders, <hi>my tongue</hi> was glad; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.26. And when is our tongue our glory, but when it ſpeaks to the glory of God? when its words are ſavory and gracious; but if our tongue be a lying tongue, a ſlandring tongue, or any other way evil, 'tis then our ſhame. Oh, the vaſt difference that there is between a good and a bad tongue! <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The tongue of the juſt</hi> is as choice ſilver (a precious commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity)
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106424:156"/>but <hi>the heart of the wicked</hi> (and therefore his tongue) is little worth, 'tis but droſs; he pays too dear by a farthing, that pays but a farthing for that which is nothing worth: and this is ſo little worth, that he cannot tell how little, worth nothing, or if you will, <hi>'tis worſe then nought</hi> in being naught. Again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18. there is that ſpeaketh (<hi>Daggers,</hi> as we ſay) like the piercing of a Sword, dangerous and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, but <hi>the tongue</hi> of the wiſe is (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a medicine or wholeſom, but in the abſtract) health. There is as much difference between a good and bad tongue, as between ſoundneſs and wounds, health and ſickneſs. Yet once more, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.4. <hi>an wholeſom tongue</hi> is a tree of life (which is for healing) but perverſneſs therein is a breach in the ſpirit: and a wounded ſpirit who can bear? or who can bear up under a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpirit? But,</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly conſider this, <hi>God will judge us for and by our words,</hi> as well as by our works and actions. There is a place may make us tremble, and ſhould ingage us to take heed of our words, while we have a day to live, 'tis in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12 36. I ſay unto you, that every <hi>idle word</hi> that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in the day of Judgment; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. for <hi>by thy words</hi> thou ſhalt be juſtified, and <hi>by thy words</hi> thou ſhalt be condemned. If we muſt give an account of idle, what account ſhall we give of filthy and ill-working words! of words that are corrupt, and do corrupt others! <hi>Solomon</hi> upon this account tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.21. death and life are in the power of the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106424:156"/>tongue; a man ſhall be judged and ſentenced according to it. There is ſuch a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween heart, tongue, and deed, that he who is judged by one, is judged by all of them, for <hi>they agree in one.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, that though all the charge, or moſt of it, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. is for words, the ſin of the tongue. 1. In abuſing Gods good Word. 2. Uſing their own ill words, they gave their mouth to evil, &amp;c. yet that the heart was conſenting, and the deed executing, <hi>there was a concurrence and co-working of all three:</hi> after his words are ſpoken of, ſaith God, theſe things haſt thou done, and it follows, thou thoughteſt, &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. but I will judge thee, <hi>viz.</hi> for all this, yet eſpecially for thy words, according to what is ſaid, <hi>Jude</hi> 15. Behold, the Lord cometh to execute judgment upon all, to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their (mark it) <hi>their hard ſpeeches</hi> which they have ſpoken againſt him: yea, againſt him in his members. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. their mouth ſpeaks <hi>great ſwelling words, viz.</hi> as Murmurers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers uſe to do: they will jeer the people of God, and twit them with the name of Holy and Spiritual, and utter <hi>hard ſpeeches</hi> againſt them; but when Chriſt comes to Judgment, he will call to account for all <hi>the hard ſpeeches, and all the great ſwelling words,</hi> which by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint they have ſpoken againſt his members; or by way of flattery and admiration (for lucres ſake) they have ſpoken in commendation and praiſe of wicked and cruel men. Oh, take
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106424:157"/>heed of tongue-ſins; when <hi>Dives</hi> was in Hell, the part that (it ſeems) was moſt tormented, was <hi>his tongue;</hi> for he begs water to cool his tongue, which gives ſome occaſion to think that (even in relation to <hi>Lazarus</hi>) he had ſinned much with his tongue, and uſed hard ſpeeches againſt poor <hi>Lazarus;</hi> for 'twas by him he would have the water brought: <hi>In quo peccamus, in hoc plecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> as and in what we ſin, we ſmart and are pained and plagued, as <hi>Dives</hi> with and in his tongue. <hi>If the tongue be ſet on fire of Hell while on earth, Ah, how will it be ſet on fire when in Hell!</hi> The ſins of the mouth cry for vengeance with an open mouth, and make others cry for it too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.11, 12, 13. the holy man (not yet King, but Prophet) prays, ſcatter them, bring them down, O Lord! why, <hi>David,</hi> why ſo ſevere, what have they done? Oh, <hi>'tis for the ſin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,</hi> for their curſing and lying; and then he is at it again, conſume them, conſume them in thy wrath. This is the dreadful imprecation that the ſin of their mouth occaſioned this merciful and good perſon to make againſt them, and to beg God to execute it upon them. <hi>Sad will the account be that men will have to make for ſpeaking, as for working of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On all theſe conſiderations, let me beſeech you to take heed as to your words, and, 1. <hi>let your words be few;</hi> and that not only in your commerce and converſation with men, but in your addreſſes to God, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2. God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth, therefore <hi>let thy words be few;</hi> which is much of the meaning
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106424:157"/>of our Saviour in the Prayer which he taught his Diſciples, as will appear by comparing the 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 'Tis a vanity that attends men in Religion, that they think to be heard for their loud and much ſpeaking; <hi>ſilence were better then ill-ſpeaking, yea</hi> (and many times) <hi>then much-ſpeaking.</hi> 'Tis true, there is a time to ſpeak, as there is to be ſilent (and happy they that improve it well) but yet 'tis ſeldom that a multitude of words are without ſin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that refraineth his lips is wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Silence diſcovers wiſdom, and conceals igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and 'tis a property ſo much belonging to wiſe men, that the Oracle tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.28: That a fool when he holds his peace, is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiſe, and he that ſhuts his lips, is eſteemed a man of underſtanding: And as a very worthy and noble Perſon expreſſeth it, <hi>If ſilence were as much in faſhion, as 'tis charitable to mankind to wiſh it, the Regions of Hell would be far thinlier peopled, then now they are like to be.</hi> Many have repented for uſing their tongues too much; 'tis true, a man that holds his peace may offend with his tongue, but 'tis a more ſcarce and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom crime, then that of much (which is uſually too much) ſpeaking. 'Tis Goſpel-doctrine which teacheth us to be ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak, <hi>James</hi> 1.19. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s imperfection or defect would be an excellency in ſome perſons, <hi>to be ſlow of ſpeech;</hi> and 'twere well with ſome, if they had got ſuch a cold, as would keep them from ſpeaking. Oh, the <hi>prittle, prattle</hi> that abounds among the <hi>buſie bodies</hi> of this world! and there are many, not only vain, but <hi>unruly</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:106424:158"/>talkers, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.10. that a man had need of more patience to hear them, then to hear the beating of an unbraced Drum: and, alas, 'tis not only the chat and tattle of idle Goſſips (ſuch as, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13.) who ſpake unbecomingly, and things which they ought not; but much of the diſcourſe that waſtes mens time (who would be loth to drink and ſwear it away) conſiſts of talk that flatters the preſent, or detracts from the abſent; cenſuring of Superiors, or deſpiſing of Inferiors! what empty and ridiculous, if not frothy diſcourſes (that excite to carnality) are the common entertainments, even among them that pretend to better things! what's ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſe good for, but to quench zeal and fervency, yea, the ready way to loſe credit and good name; and if not innocency, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways time, which is too precious to be ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd away and loſt, much more to be ſinned away! Shall a man of much talk be juſtified, <hi>Job</hi> 11.2. Oh no, <hi>much talk is full of folly;</hi> for a dream cometh through a multitude of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a fools voice is known by multitude of words, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.3. and in the multitude of dreams and <hi>many words,</hi> are divers vanities; but fear thou God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>as if multitude of words were inconſiſtent with the fear of God;</hi> for to that purpoſe the words ſound. We cannot well ſpeak too little, unleſs we ſpeak by command from God, and in obedience to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we will, or muſt be ſpeaking, <hi>let us ſpeak as we ought,</hi> let our words be wholeſom words, ſuch as carry Phyſick and health in them: ſafe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:106424:158"/>and ſound ſpeech that may not be gain-ſaid nor reproved: that may do no hurt, but that may do good. We ſhould ſpeak that which is good to edifie men, that which is good for our ſelves and others, <hi>either naturally, civilly, morally, or ſpiritually good,</hi> as occaſion offers and requires. I intend no particular enumeration of <hi>Tongue-ſins</hi> to be avoided, nor any diſtinct and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſcourſe about ſpeaking and ordering our Tongues; but only to hint theſe things in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, leaving the particular Application and Improvement to be made by every man, as his own caſe calls for; and therefore to conclude this, I ſhall commend but theſe two things in relation hereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Look well to your hearts,</hi> if they be not well kept, your tongues will be ill kept; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. keep thine heart with all diligence, or (as 'tis in the Hebrew) <hi>above all keeping:</hi> it needs more keeping then any thing elſe, for all the reſt are at the hearts diſpoſe, both faculties and members; therefore keep a ſtrict watch and ſtrong guard over thine heart; the ſpeaking of the tongue is from the muſing of the heart, which is as fire in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom that cannot be hid, but will break out into a flame of words, as the Phraſes are uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. when thou art heart-full, thy mouth will run over, and if the fountain of thy heart be bitter, the ſtreams of thy words cannot be ſweet. When Holy <hi>David</hi> prayed that the words of his mouth might be acceptable, he prays for this in relation to it, <hi>Let the meditations of my heart be acceptable, Pſal.</hi> 19.14. If the latter,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106424:159"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> our meditations be not; the former, <hi>viz</hi> our words, are not like to be acceptable. When our heart ſpeaks our words, our words ſpeak our heart, and 'tis but one thing: and no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doth our heart indite a good matter, but our tongue will be as the Pen of a ready Writer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. The heart of the wiſe teacheth his mouth, <hi>Prov</hi> 16.23. the Hebrew is, <hi>maketh his mouth wiſe:</hi> the fool ſpeaks with an open mouth, any thing that's uppermoſt; but a wiſe man opens his mouth and ſpeaks, gravely, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon deliberation. The mouth needs going to School, and if we will have it wiſe, let us get it a <hi>wiſe heart</hi> to be its Tutor, to teach it the art and grace of ſpeaking wiſely and well; the heart of the wiſe teacheth his mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pray to God,</hi> for prayer is the means-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for preſervation and ſanctification of heart, tongue, and life: lift up thy heart and ſoul to him, and pray as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.14 of which I new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpake; and ſay as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.15. <hi>O Lord,</hi> open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe; and as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.8. let <hi>my mouth</hi> be filled with thy praiſe, and with thine honour all the day. And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.3, 4. ſet a watch, O Lord, before <hi>my mouth,</hi> and keep the door of my lips, and incline not my heart to any evil thing. <hi>That's well kept that God keeps,</hi> and if he keep not the City, the watchmen watch in vain. Commit thy ſelf to the Keeper of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all will be well, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3.</p>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:106424:160"/>returned not to the Lord according to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit he had received, nor did anſwer the end of it, but was guilty of not being humble or thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, though he ſung a Song of Praiſe (and it ſeems, annually) unto God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrath was upon him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32 25. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.20.

Though God in caſes of ſuch neceſſity diſpenſe with his Sabbath, and conſequently his inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on that day; yet holy men lament this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and mourn that they are reſtrained from bearing a part with others, and forced to do that which elſe were not lawful to do on a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day: and 'tis on this account (not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude others) that (as I conceive) our Saviour bid the Diſciples pray, that their flight might not be on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.20. For the uſual
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106424:160"/>Ordinances of the day could not be enjoy'd, nor the ordinary Duties of the day practiſed and performed. But,</p>

When the fleſh was weak, and the ſpirit willing, Chriſt himſelf excuſed them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. but if the ſpirit be unwilling, 'tis no excuſe, though the fleſh be never ſo weak.

But <hi>Saul</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt of the ſheep and oxen, &amp;c. and would not utterly deſtroy them; whereupon it follows, that the Lord repented of having ſet up <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. and though it were pretended to be done for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. yet 'tis charged upon him as rebellion and witchcraft, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. and <hi>his not obeying the voice of the Lord, is called a doing evil in his ſight, verſ</hi> 19. ſo that he who omits a good, commits an evil; <hi>the omiſſion of good is the commiſſion of evil,</hi> and judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Oh, how dear did this ſin of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion coſt <hi>Saul;</hi> Another inſtance is,</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Eli</hi> (which is remarkable) who is charged with honouring his ſons before God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. how ſo? <hi>Eli</hi> was a good old man, and can it be thought that he preferr'd his ſons before God? what ſhould the meaning of this be? ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.13. and there 'tis cleared up; for ſaith God, I will judge his houſe for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth, becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and <hi>he reſtrained them not:</hi> he did not give them ſo much as a ſowre look, or as the Hebrew reads it, <hi>he frowned not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106424:164"/>upon them.</hi> And yet let me tell you, <hi>Eli</hi> went ſo far, that had his children had any ingenuity, or any reſpect to the rebukes of a Prieſt and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one would have thought he had ſaid enough, for <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.23. &amp;c. the old man very gravely takes them up with this expoſtulation, <hi>Why do you do ſuch things?</hi> for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people, nay, my ſont, for it is no good report which I hear, ye make the Lords people to tranſgreſs; if one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him, but if a man ſins againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him? thus he layes their ſin and danger before them pretty roundly, and yet, ſaith God, he reſtrained them not, there was an omiſſion and neglect of more ſevere diſcipline; and this omiſſion coſt him dear, as dear almoſt as the ſins of commiſſion did coſt his ſons, which was not to be purged with Sacrifice, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance, is that concerning the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> (who were <hi>a baſtard brood</hi>) and therefore like Baſtards, they were not to enter into the Congregation of the Lord, till the tenth generation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2, 3, 4. and the reaſon is taken, 1.

No mans Calling neceſſitates him to ſin; there's many a Trade, of which I ſcruple not to ſay, 'tis no Calling: <hi>many make Trades for a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bood of that which is no Calling;</hi> Harlotry and Thieving are no Callings; for we are called, not to uncleanneſs, but to holineſs: and as to lawful Callings, ſin is but accidental, and ſprings up more from our inclination, then 'tis occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Callings.

Yet,</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay this, there are ſnares in our Callings, the Devil lays his nets and baits every where: he lays his ſnares to intangle us, not only in our general, but particular Callings, to turn all our duties into ſins. <hi>Many men do ſin, and moſt men are liable</hi> (being tempted) <hi>to ſin in their Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> There are many temptations attend and wait on every Calling; and were I to ſpeak to men of any Calling, I would follow the example
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106424:168"/>of St. <hi>John, Luke</hi> 3.10. &amp;c. who ſpake to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to the ſin he was guilty of, or tempted to in his place: The <hi>Publicans</hi> were very great oppreſſors, and therefore he calls on them to exact no more then their due; your ſtated and appointed allowance; the <hi>ſouldiers</hi> were boiſterous and unruly, and therefore he ſpeaks to them to do violence to no man, or (as in the Margine) to put no man in fear; do not trepan men, and falſely accuſe them; do not plunder and ſteal, but be content with your pay. But ſeeing I cannot ſpeak to every particular, I will lay before you ſome things in general, which may be applyed to each and every one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of <hi>lying and equivocating,</hi> which is a thing grown ſo common in buying and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it paſſeth but for words of courſe; <hi>It coſt me more,</hi> and yet ſell it for leſs; <hi>I cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it,</hi> yet take the money; <hi>I will get nothing by you,</hi> as if men could buy and ſell, and live by the loſs; do you think that men believe this, or do you your ſelves believe it without one or other equivocal diſtinction? I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to tell you the words you ſhall uſe, but I tell you from the Lord, that you ſhould <hi>uſe but few, and ſpeak in truth,</hi> in a multitude of words there wants not ſin; for the ſeller to extol a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity with variety of words, and tell men, <hi>'tis the beſt in town, there cannot better be bought for gold, &amp;c.</hi> is many times but a Trade-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement; ſo for the buyer, to ſay its naught, its naught, and when he is gone, to boaſt, is not ſhort of a ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. or to ſay, he will give no more, though he intend to do it. <hi>Words
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106424:168"/>are precious commodities, and ſhould not be expoſed at an adventure:</hi> What's beyond yea and nay, and reacheth to ſuperfluity, cometh of evil, and evil comes of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.37. <hi>James</hi> 5.12. and if you tell untruths and lyes, 'tis as bad as ſtealing, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.11. ye ſhall not ſteal, nor deal falſely, nor lye one unto another. He that lyeth, doth conſtructively ſteal: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. joyns lyars and ſtealers, and perjured perſons together, and tells us, that the Law is againſt them all, and that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſound Doctrine: and if mans Law were as Gods, <hi>there would be a recovery of reſtitution for what's gotten by lying, as for what is ſtollen, Levit.</hi> 6.1-5. and before you can come to God with your offering, you ought to reſtore that which is gotten by fraud, as well as that which is gotten by force; yea, to lye is a thing inconſiſtent with being a Child of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (among the dogs) are lyars, and ſhall (if they repent not) have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.15. and the getting of treaſure by a lying tongue, is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity toſſed to and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:106424:169"/>an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.22. but they that deal truly are his delight: which had you rather be, abhorred, or delighted in by God? think of this in your Ware-houſes and Shops, or when you go abroad to buy or ſell, that you may do all in truth. Methinks I hear your wives and children begging of you, Oh, do not lye to be rich, do not venture your going to Hell to leave me an eſtate! Thus do I deal plainly and truly with you, that you may do ſo with all men, and I hope you will not take it ill, that I endeavour to do you good; if you do, I ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>forgive me this wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of putting men off, and paying them with falſe and unlawful money; as you ſhould not buy ſtollen and unlawful goods, ſo you ſhould not pay unlawful money, <hi>that which you would not take, and know that others will not receive, if it be diſcerned:</hi> The children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſhould be like him, who when he had bought, he weighed or told out his ſilver, <hi>current money</hi> with the Merchant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.16. And this ſin is ſo much the worſe (<hi>viz.</hi> paying of braſs and uncurrent money) becauſe it uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls into the hands of the poor, who can leaſt diſcern, and ſuffer moſt by the receiving of it; do as you would be done unto, and <hi>do not pay that which is not payment,</hi> but an abuſe and wrong.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Uſe not falſe weights or meaſures, nor keep your books falſely: take heed of writing down more then was delivered or bargained for, or writing greater prices then were agreed upon. As to falſe weights and meaſures, they
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:106424:169"/>are utterly forbidden, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.35, 36. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.13-16. you are to have a ſtandard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure, and not think it enough to have one only <hi>when the Queſt comes,</hi> but all the year long, or elſe you (as your weights and meaſures) are an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.10. You have a good ſaying (and I wiſh it be made good) you ſhall have your weight, or meaſure, or tale, though you buy it for a penny or a farthing. Saith God, ſhall I count them pure with the wicked ballance and deceitful weights? <hi>no, no,</hi> let them never be ſo great Profeſſors, I will not count them pure, but an abomination, <hi>Micah.</hi> 6.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed of counterfeit and falſe Lights; alas, one can hardly ſee day by day in many mens ſhops, they either ſhut out the light, or let it in, one ſcarce ſees how: men may ſeek for light at noon-day. Men have learnt to draw up or let down ſo much by the Ell or by the Yard, that people can ſcarce ſee what they look upon with their eyes: That which ſeemed very fine and fair by a falſe light, is found far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by a true one. Now by the ſame reaſon that weights are, lights are an abomination to the Lord, <hi>viz. becauſe they are falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> If you tell me, 'tis the cuſtom of the City and all the world, I ask you, whether that will anſwer God, and make it no ſin?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Take heed of breaking Bargains and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, when you perceive you can buy cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of, or ſell dearer to another: I am almoſt afraid that this practical kind of Religion is with many like an old Almanack out of date,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106424:170"/>as if Religion were confined to the firſt Table (ſome Duties to God) and the ſecond Table (Duties to Man) were of little concern or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; when as moſt frequently in holy Writ the characters of godly men are drawn from their obedience to the ſecond Table-commands, and among the reſt this that I am upon is one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. he that ſweareth, and changeth not, though it be to his loſs and detriment: and it ought to hold good in promiſes as well as oaths, in bargaining as well as ſwearing; for <hi>a man ought to be juſt, though he have not ſworn to be ſo,</hi> but wo to them that promiſe and ſwear too, yet are not juſt, but falſe and perjured both.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed of carnal and ſinful compliance with your Cuſtomers and Chapmen in their ſwearing, drinking to exceſs, &amp;c. <hi>have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi> though you profit by them that work them, <hi>but reprove them rather, Eph.</hi> 5.11. and ſo you ſhall not ſuffer ſin upon your brother (nor upon your ſelves) <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. otherwiſe 'tis to hate him in your heart, which is a great ſin; for he that hates his brother is a murtherer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:106424:170"/>your ways pleaſe the Lord, he can and will make your enemies to be (friends) at peace with you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. Whatever you do, <hi>keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God and men,</hi> and though the children of this world ſhould call you fools, yet they will call themſelves fools another day, for calling you ſo now: 'tis undoubtedly better and more profitable to pleaſe God then men; and what will it profit thee to gain the world, and loſe thy ſoul? we are too prone to comply with, and to be drawn away by them we get by, and have therefore a kindneſs for them; but conſider what God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.12-15. Take heed leſt thou make a Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land, leſt it prove a ſnare to thee, that when they do ſacrifice to their Gods, <hi>and one call thee,</hi> and thou eat of their Sacrifice; <hi>intimacy, and familiarity, and trading together, may be a ſnare, Gen.</hi> 34.21. And when a good Cuſtomer calls thee, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is like to make thee to do like him; rather then men will loſe their gain, they will cry up <hi>Diana,</hi> though they cry down <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and God himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.23-28.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Take heed of abuſing and grinding the face of the poor, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.15. either, 1. <hi>By ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of their neceſſity;</hi> you know they muſt have it, becauſe they need it, and their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is urgent, Oh, do not be cruel to them; you know they muſt ſell at the weeks end to buy bread, or at Quarters end to pay Rent; Oh, do not oppreſs them, and add affliction to their affliction, by making them under-ſell the ſweat of their brow, and labour of their hands;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:106424:171"/>wo to thee, if the ſpoil of the poor be in thy houſe, <hi>Iſa</hi> 3.15. <hi>Nor do thou take any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their ignorance,</hi> to over-reach and defraud them: ignorance ſhould be pitied, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful ſhould be well uſed; it may be, he refers himſelf to thee; Oh, do not put a bad for a good commodity into his hands. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2.

This is <hi>a crying</hi> ſin, as you may read, <hi>James</hi> 5.4. Poor ſouls, they have wrought hard, and when they have done, they go home and cry for want of money to buy bread, and truly this cry of theirs enters into the ears of the Lord of Hoſts, for ſo <hi>Sabaoth</hi> ſignifies; and though thou be too mighty for the poor, yet thou art no match for the Lord of Hoſts, who takes their part, and will not always bear with thy covetouſneſs and oppreſſion. Oh, pay off the poor, as ſoon as they have done their work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grind them not <hi>by forcing upon them braided and traſhy ware,</hi> becauſe they are in your debt: You complain many times that your Chapmen break, and 'tis to be feared they may complain that you break them; either by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing too much, or very bad commodities into their hand, which they cannot vend or put off but to their great loſs. They are in your books, and for fear of your diſpleaſure, leſt you ſhould arreſt them, they are willing to take it of you:

               <p n="2">2. We may be the occaſion of other mens ſins <hi>by counſelling them to ſin;</hi> they that cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, may counſel, which is next to it: 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded three times in one Chapter, in three ſucceſſive verſes, that <hi>Ahaziah</hi> walked in the ways of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and did evil in the ſight of the Lord, by the counſel of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> to his deſtruction, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.3, 4, 5. So <hi>Amnon</hi> ſinned according to the counſel of <hi>Jonadab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.5.6. <hi>Jonadab</hi> is called his friend, and friends uſe to take ſweet counſel together; but, <hi>Oh, what bitter counſel is wicked counſel!</hi> never counſel any to ſin under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of friendſhip, 'tis killing kindneſs, and as <hi>Rebeccah</hi> told <hi>Jacob</hi> when ſhe counſelled him to lye and counterfeit, that upon her ſhould the curſe be, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.6-13. So ſay I to thee, the curſe will be on thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By Example;</hi> and the more eminent the example, the more taking 'tis: Great men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin at a little or low rate, becauſe they are examples; the ſins of Commanders, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſins; ſins of Rulers, ruling ſins; ſins of Teachers, teaching ſins: there is a kind of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:106424:177"/>ſorcery and bewitchingneſs goes along with ſuch examples, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12, 13. When <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Jews diſſembled with him, <hi>Barnabas</hi> (though a good man, and full of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24. yet) he alſo was carried away with (by the example of, and in compliance with) their diſſimulation; ſo that example which I newly ſpake to, is inſtanced in as very catching and infectious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>The world is more eaſily exampled into ſin then into goodneſs;</hi> for ſin finds a party within. Abrahams <hi>Faith,</hi> Moſes <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> Jobs <hi>Patience,</hi> Peters <hi>Courage</hi> are not ſo eaſily followed, as their contraries. Give no ill Examples.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By Tempting</hi> (Devil-like) and provoking to ſin. The Trumpeter (according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue) though he do not fight, yet if taken, ſpeeds as ill as the ſouldiers that do, becauſe he ſtirs them up: and when <hi>Ahabs</hi> wickedneſs is reckoned up, 'tis with this remark, that his wife <hi>Jezebel</hi> incited or ſtirred him up, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25. There was none like to <hi>Ahab,</hi> he had no peer, no fellow, he was a non-ſuch in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and this he was irritated and provokt to by his wife. Take heed of tempting, or ſtirring up any to ſin. Some mens corruptions would ſleep more then they do, if others did not awake and ſtir them up. Some are ſo wicked, as not to ſleep, nor let others to ſleep, till they have done miſchief. Men may tempt others to ſin ſeveral ways, I ſhall name but ſome.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By inticement and ſollicitation; <hi>'tis a ſad employment to be ſins ſollicitor,</hi> yet too many ſuch there are; Pimps, Bawds, and Panders for
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:106424:177"/>luſt and ſin: and though the ſollicited perſon do not ſin, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did not, yet the ſollicitor is a ſinner, as his Miſtreſs was. There are ſinners that go up and down (like the Devil) to entice others to ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10-16. even flattery hath a force in it, and offers a kind of violence, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Importunity; <hi>Delilah</hi> made poor <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> almoſt weary of his life, ſhe never left him till ſhe had undone him; he ſtood it out a great while, but her importunity prevailed at laſt, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.16, 17. and 'twas by much fair ſpeech, or importunity that the Harlot prevailed with the young man, who it may be was going about his buſineſs, and thought no hurt, till ſhe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.13. with 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By lying to men <hi>in the Name of the Lord,</hi> as the old Prophet did to the young, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.18. The Name of the Lord is a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and very taking with them that fear him, and therefore ſome (falſe Prophets) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and turn themſelves into Angels of light, though they be of the Devil, and quote Gods authority, as he had the impudence to do (though falſely) to our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.3, 4. This is a ſhrewd way of temptation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By giving undecent language, and offering affronts to perſons. Some men have laviſh tongues, and can hardly anſwer without a thou lyeſt, &amp;c. ſuch is their pride and paſſion, that they anſwer rudely, and give ſuch ill language, <hi>as would anger a Saint,</hi> as the ſaying is. Perſons of Quality and Honor that are uſed to, and deſerve Civility, will not bear ſuch provoking words,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:106424:178"/>nor take them but on the point of their Rapier, and return it to the givers throat. <hi>Great ſins are committed from ſuch beginnings;</hi> therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. that a ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath, as it did <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.2, 3. but grievous (and fierce) words ſtir up anger, as they did 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.43. compared with <hi>Chap:</hi> 20.1. God will not allow Parents to provoke their children to wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. As unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom words, ſo ill and ill-becoming behaviours, abuſes, and affronts tempt men to ſin; when <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons had deceived, and by it ſlew the <hi>Sichemites</hi> (as the Law did <hi>Paul,</hi> for ſo he ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11.) they made this ſurly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (as an excuſe) to their Father, ſhould he deal with our Siſter as with an Harlot? <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.31. as if his ſin juſtified theirs, and they did well to be angry; we could not put up ſuch an abuſe and diſhonour. Oh, give no provoking language, to put men upon ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By ſending others to inſnare and trepan them; <hi>they that employ ſuch decoys, are in part guilty of their ſin,</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus called it Tempting, when ſuch were employed to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and inſnare him. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſent the <hi>Herodians,</hi> who ſhould feign themſelves juſt men, and praiſe him into a ſnare, and court him into <hi>(crimen laeſae majeſtatis)</hi> a crime againſt <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar:</hi> They pretend a caſe of conſcience, but ſaith our Saviour to this ſort of men (Spies and Catchpoles) Why tempt ye me, <hi>ye Hypocrites:</hi> They that were employed ſinned, and ſo did they that employed them. See the ſtory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. and <hi>Luke</hi> 20. I ſhall name no more, though
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:106424:178"/>there be too many more of this nature; but add only one other thing, whereby we may occaſion other mens ſins. As,</p>
               <p n="6">6. By declaring a thing otherwiſe then the truth is, <hi>by mincing and equivocating;</hi> there are inſtances more then enough, wherein good men have been guilty in this kind, which I ſpeak, that Saints as well as ſinners, may hear and fear, and not do wickedly. <hi>Abraham</hi> prevails with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> to ſay ſhe was his ſiſter, whereby <hi>Pharaoh</hi> concluded ſhe was not his wife, and took her; but when God plagued <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h</hi> for ſo doing, he reaſons the caſe with <hi>Abraham.</hi> What is this that thou haſt done to me? Why didſt thou not tell me ſhe was thy wife? ſo I might have taken her to be my wife, &amp;c. <hi>a ſevere expoſtulation and an upbraid, Gen.</hi> 12. and yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is at it again, and meets with a more plain and home rebuke, and is charged with no leſs then ſin by <hi>Abimelech, verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou</hi> (even thou) <hi>haſt brought on me and my Kingdom a great ſin,</hi> thou haſt done deeds unto me, that ought not to be done; he lays the ſin at <hi>Abrahams</hi> door, and <hi>Sarah</hi> alſo (for her ſuppleneſs) had a reproof from him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. yet after all this, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> is found tandy in the ſame thing, and meets with the ſame rebuke, and that from one who pretended not to ſuch, or ſo much Religion as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. Alas, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by taking falſe oaths, and bearing falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, give occaſion to Judges to juſtifie the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemn the righteous.

                  <note place="margin">Of being acceſſories after ſins commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> To draw to a cloſe; be not acceſſory to other mens ſins after they are committed, which you may be guilty of many ways; I ſhall name but four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In not grieving for other mens ſins. All ſin is againſt God, and for that reaſon <hi>he that truly grieves for his own, will grieve for other mens:</hi> 'Twas the great commend of <hi>Lot,</hi> that his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſoul was vext with the filthy converſation of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> 'twas a torment, a kind of hell to him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>David</hi> could not prevent mens ſinning, and therefore grieved for it, and ſo much, that his eyes run down with rivers of tears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. And this made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wiſh his eyes fountains, that he might weep day and night. And all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were remembred by the Lord in mercy, when others were rewarded with miſery. There is ſcarce any way like this, to be kept from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the ruine of ſinners, as <hi>Ezek</hi> 9.4-6.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106424:180"/>God will ſet his mark on his weeping and mourning people, and as for the reſt, they will be found as acceſſories, if not principals in wickedneſs, and judged accordingly. <hi>Oh, that there were more crying perſons, when there are ſo many crying ſins!</hi> They that grieve not and mourn not, are guilty, as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2. and by mourning they were cleared of this matter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By concealing that which we ought to diſcover and make known, as may be eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.1. If a ſoul ſin, and hear the voice of ſwearing, and is a witneſs, whether he hath ſeen or known of it, if he do not utter it, then ſhall he bear his iniquity: and <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.24. whoſo is partner with a thief, hateth his own ſoul, he heareth curſing, and bewrayeth it not, <hi>which he ought to do.</hi> Yet once more, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6-8. if thy brother, the ſon of thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or thy ſon or thy daughter, or the wife of thy boſom, or thy friend which is as thine own ſoul, entice thee ſecretly, ſaying, let us go and ſerve other Gods (which thou haſt not known, thou nor thy fathers) thou ſhalt not conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; <hi>is that enough?</hi> no, nor hearken to him; <hi>is that enough?</hi> no, neither ſhall thine eye pity him; <hi>is that enough?</hi> no, neither ſhalt thou ſpare; <hi>is that enough?</hi> no, neither ſhalt thou conceal him; <hi>is that enough?</hi> no, thou ſhalt <hi>(by diſcovering him to the judges)</hi> ſurely kill him, thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him, &amp;c. but you will ſay, is not this unnatural? what! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a brother, one of the ſame venter, the ſon of my mother? nay more, my own ſon; nay
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106424:181"/>more, my wife, and moſt of all, my friend; no matter, for all that <hi>thou ſhalt not conceal him:</hi> to conceal ſuch a ſinner, were to partake of his ſin, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11. Theſe Spirits, theſe ſoul-ſtealers muſt not be concealed, leſt the receiver and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealer be reckoned as bad as the thief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may be acceſſory to other mens ſins, in not ſeparating from them when God calls you to it. Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife who was loth to withdraw, and was turned into a Pillar of Salt (as the Father ſaid) to ſeaſon us. There are perſons with whom we ſhould not eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>To joyn in communion with known ſinners, is the greateſt teſtimony you can give, either that they are Saints, or you are ſinners:</hi> you bear a falſe witneſs for them, and a true witneſs againſt your ſelves. When the Apoſtle had reckoned up a whole troop of ſinners, of whom ſelf-love led the Van, and a form of godlineſs brought up the Rear, he adds, from ſuch turn away, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. You may hear a voice from Heaven, ſaying, come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins; be not therefore unequally yoked with Unbelievers, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may be acceſſory to other mens ſins, if inſtead of reproving, we approve of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but reprove them rather; <hi>not to reprove them, but inſtead thereof to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them, is to approve:</hi> and beſide this, there are three things which ſpeak appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we take pleaſure in the actions or
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106424:181"/>the actors; <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.30, 31. the Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie falſely, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo, q. d. <hi>they ſet their ſeal to it,</hi> to approve and confirm what the Prophets and Prieſts do: Of this import is that <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. Though they knew the Judgments of God, that they who did ſuch things were worthy of death; yet they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the ſame, but took pleaſure in them that did them. As men are ſaid to help on the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods people, and to approve them by ſaying, Ha, Ha, ſo would we have it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.3. and 26.2. <hi>To take pleaſure in ſuch things as others do, is to be acceſſories, and as if they had done them.</hi> When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells of other mens ſins, he doth it weeping, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. and ſo frees himſelf from any the leaſt degree of approbation: but when men laugh, take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, and make ſport of other mens ſins, 'tis (by conſtruction) an approbation of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Approbation and being acceſſory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from hence, when men flatter others, and ſpeak peace to them in their evil ways: <hi>When men ſay peace, where God ſaith there is none, i. e.</hi> to the wicked. God and man will curſe him that ſaith to the wicked, thou art righteous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.10. becauſe they have ſeduced (or flatter'd) my people, ſaying, peace, and there was no peace, and have daubed with untemper'd mortar; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. have ſowed pillows under their elbows; therefore will I pull down the wall, and will tear your your pillows and kerchiefs, becauſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. they made the hearts of the righteous ſad, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106424:182"/>ſtrengthned the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way: There is a <hi>wo</hi> againſt ſuch, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Approbation is declared by this, when any defend and excuſe other mens ſins, as if they were retained (like Lawyers) and had their fee: <hi>They that juſtifie the wicked are equally an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with them that condemn the righteous, Prov.</hi> 24.17. Some are ſo wicked, as to defend other mens wickedneſs (not only like Lawyers, but like Souldiers) by ſword and force of arms; as they did for him, who had abuſed the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> Concubine, <hi>Judges</hi> 20.14. &amp;c. but to plead for other mens ſins, is to be as guilty as they who commit it. Many more things might be added, but I forbear them, becauſe I have been ſomewhat large upon this ſubject, which I was the more willing to be, becauſe 'tis a thing too ſeldom treated, and too little taken notice of, and laid to heart, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſhare that we too often have in other mens ſins.</p>
               <p>Thus am I at laſt come to <hi>the Cloſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> of the whole matter,
<note place="margin">The Cloſe or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> and I could wiſh with my ſoul, that there may never be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me, or any other, to preach on this ſubject any more; ſhall I now intreat you to conſider of what hath been ſaid, and to bethink you what an ugly and abominable thing ſin is? <hi>The worſt of Evils,</hi> worſe then the worſt of words can expreſs it to be. I have ſhewn you how <hi>contrary 'tis to God and man;</hi> for proof whereof I have brought <hi>witneſs from Heaven, Earth, and Hell:</hi> I have ſhewn you how dear it coſt Chriſt Jeſus who dyed for it, and how dear
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:106424:182"/>it will coſt you, if you live and dye in it. <hi>Stand in awe and ſin not;</hi> lay up the Word of Gods Command, Promiſe, and Threatning, that you may not ſin againſt him: take heed of ſinning, for at once you ſin againſt God and your own ſouls. I have entred your cloſets and your hearts, to tell you of your ſecret ſins; I have told you of, and warned you againſt the ſins of your lips, and of your life; I have told you of your Shop and Calling-ſins, that you might beware: and <hi>what ſhall I ſay or do more for you?</hi> I have preacht to you, pray'd, and wept for you; I have ſhewn you the way of repentance, faith, and holineſs; and were it to dye for you, I hope I ſhould not account my life dear to me, that I might ſave your ſouls by loſing it. Oh, let me again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, beſeech, and beg you for Gods ſake and your ſouls ſake not to ſin <hi>(theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that ye ſin not)</hi> but as 'tis, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.15, 16, 17. Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud, for the Lord hath ſpoken, give glory to the Lord God, &amp;c. But if ye will not hear, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride, and mine eyes ſhall weep ſore, and run down with tears. If you hear not, you make this ſad work for me, and others that teach you, but (alas!) much ſadder for your ſelves; <hi>you make us weep on earth, but you</hi> (if you repent not) <hi>will weep in Hell.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore, learn what the grace (the ſaving grace) of God teacheth you, to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent world, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. or as 'tis in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. to ſerve the Lord in righteouſneſs and true holineſs
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:106424:183"/>all the days of your life; and as 'tis 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Having theſe promiſes (which according to 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.4. are the greateſt and precious) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God. Shall we commend holineſs in them that are dead, and not like holineſs in our ſelves while we are alive? <hi>Holineſs is the beauty of Earth and Heaven,</hi> without which we cannot live well on Earth, nor ſhall ever live in Heaven: certainly they that jeer and ſcoff at holineſs, and rejoyce that they are none of the <hi>holy ones,</hi> they do as if they ſhould make Bon-fires, ring the Bells, and give thanks that they ſhall never be ſaved; for if they be not holy, ſaved they cannot be: or as one words it, they that ſhall be in Heaven, will be in no danger to be derided for the ſake of piety, for thoſe that deride it, will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there. And as for the wicked, God will turn them into Hell, and all the Nations (all them of any Nation) that forget God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Poor Soul,</hi> think a little, yea, think much of the great day of thine accounts &amp; Gods judgment, which though thou put far from thee, yet it will ſurely come; and wo unto thee, if it overtake thee unawares, and as a thief in the night, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3, 4. Seeing this may be, and that will be, Oh, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſations and godlineſſes! (as 'tis in the Greek) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>What ſhall I ſay more?</hi> I will ſhut up all with what was long ſince excellently ſpoken by a great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and which is worthy to be written in the hearts of all men, and to be often
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:106424:183"/>before their eyes, and in their thoughts: 'tis this,</p>
               <p>At the laſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> there will come a day, when all mankind ſhall be ſummon'd naked <hi>(without difference or degrees)</hi> before the ſame Tribunal; when the Crowns of Kings and ſhackles of Priſoners; when the Robes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the rags of Beggars; when the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants Bravery, the Peaſants Ruſſet, the Statiſts Policy, the Courtiers Luxury, and the Scholars Curioſity, ſhall be all laid aſide; when all men ſhall be reduced to an equal Plea, and <hi>without reſpect of perſons,</hi> ſhall be doomed according to their works. <hi>Then</hi> thoſe Punctoes and Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Cuts and Faſhions, Diſtances and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>(which are now the darling-ſins of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the world)</hi> ſhall be proved to have been nothing elſe, but well-acted vanities. <hi>Then</hi> the Pride, Luxury, Riot, Swaggerings, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded and complemental Oaths, nice and quaint Laſciviouſneſs, new-invented Courtings, and Adorations of Beauty <hi>(the ſo much ſtudied and admired ſins of the Gallantry of the world)</hi> ſhall be pronounced out of the mouth of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to have been nothing elſe but glittering abominations. <hi>Then</hi> the adulterating of Wares, the counterfeiting of Lights, the double Weight and falſe Meaſures, the courteous Equivocations of men greedy of gain <hi>(which are now almoſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the very Art of Trading)</hi> ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced nothing elſe but Myſteries of iniquity and ſelf-deceivings. <hi>Then</hi> the curious ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of more choice Wits, the knotty Queſtions and vain ſtrife of words, the diſputes of Reaſon,
